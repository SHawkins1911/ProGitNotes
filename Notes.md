***About Git***

**DVCS - Distributed Version Control System:** fully mirrors repositories, including their full history making each clone a full backup

**Main goals for Git were:**

* 	Speed
*  	Simple Design
*  	Strong support for non-linear development(thousands of parallel branches)
*  	Fully Distributed
*  	Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently 
 	(speed and data size) 
 	
**How does it work?**
